Modeling Approach:

Algorithm Selection: Due to the mixed nature of the data, a decision tree-based ensemble algorithm like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting was chosen for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features effectively.

Cross-Validation: To assess the model's performance and generalization ability, cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) were employed during the training phase.

Expected Out-of-Sample Error:

The expected out-of-sample error was estimated through cross-validation. The model's performance on unseen data can be inferred from the cross-validation results.


Challenges and Decisions:


Handling Missing Data: The dataset contained missing values that required careful consideration. Imputation methods were chosen based on the nature of the missing data.

Feature Engineering: The dataset included a wide range of features, and engineering new features or transforming existing ones was considered to enhance model performance.

Model Evaluation Metric: The choice of evaluation metric (accuracy, F1 score, etc.) was influenced by the nature of the problem and the importance of correctly predicting each exercise class.

Prediction on Test Cases:

The final trained model was used to predict the "classe" variable for 20 different test cases, providing insights into its real-world applicability.


Conclusion:

The predictive model developed demonstrates promising results in predicting exercise quality based on the provided metrics. Continuous refinement and optimization could further enhance the model's performance. Regular monitoring and updates may be necessary to adapt to changes in data patterns or the introduction of new features.
